# TRAVIS-BLOGDOWN

## _You write (Rmd) posts, and Travis CI does the rest of work_

This is an example website on how to use Travis CI to build and deploy your website automatically. The idea can be applied to Github Pages, Amazon S3, and Netlify, etc. For this particular example, I'm using Github Pages.

```{r comment=''}
cat('Hello World!')
```
