My research is focused on maximising the utility or real world data through record linkage and deriving robust evidence and actionable insights. 
I work across education, health and social care domains, with extensive experience of unscheduled care and cancer services, especially in 
identifying measures to monitor performance and evaluate changes to services.

I previously supported work on the appraisal of alcohol policies through decision modelling, with a particular focus on specialist alcohol treatment services.
